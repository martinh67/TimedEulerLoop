My fourth assignment for week 4 for Fundamentals of Programming completed **06/12/2020**:

The factorial of a nonnegative integer n, written as n!, is a mathematical calculation that is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n.  The calculation of factorials is one of the example of the use of recursion.  The calculation can be written as

n! = n * (n-1) * (n-2) * â€¦ 1

where 1! = 1, and 0! is defined to be 1 as well.

In this exercise, you will be using factorials to calculate a mathematical series.
